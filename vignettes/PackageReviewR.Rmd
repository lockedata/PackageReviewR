We often need to get an overview of a package, compile it's documentation, and perhap similar tasks. PackageReviewR aims to help people perform these sorts of tasks.

## Tasks
### Package dependencies
### R CMD CHECK results
### Documentation
### Package website
### GitHub statistics
### Tests and code coverage

## Document types
This package comes with a template rmarkdown document to use to produce documentation. To produce your own, you can take a copy and amend it, start from scratch or simply render it using a different document render format.
